          p The 3D printing service is provided by Shapeways. The terrain models are created by printing layer and layer of binder material and colored ink into a bed of gypsum-based powder. The products are then finished with a cyanoacrylate (what super glue is made of) sealant to ensure durability and vivid colors. The final product is a hard, slightly brittle material.
